            Recipient: Adam and Eve<br>
            Quote: <blockquote>“Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”</blockquote></p>
            <p><strong>Exodus 20:2-3 (KJV)</strong><br>
            Speaker: God<br>
            Recipient: Israelites (via Moses)<br>
            Quote: <blockquote>“I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”</blockquote></p>
            <p><strong>Matthew 28:18-19 (KJV)</strong><br>
            Speaker: Christ<br>
            Recipient: Disciples<br>
            Quote: <blockquote>“All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”</blockquote></p>
            <p><strong>Revelation 1:8 (KJV)</strong><br>
            Speaker: Christ<br>
            Recipient: John<br>
            Quote: <blockquote>“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.”</blockquote></p>
            <p><strong>1 Enoch 1:9 (R.H. Charles)</strong><br>

        <section id="noah">
            <h2>Birth of Noah</h2>
            <p><strong>1 Enoch 106:1-19 (R.H. Charles)</strong><br>
            Quote: <blockquote>“And after some days my son Methuselah took a wife for his son Lamech, and she became pregnant by him and bore a son. And his body was white as snow and red as the blooming of a rose, and the hair of his head and his long locks were white as wool, and his eyes beautiful…”</blockquote></p>
            <p><strong>Significance</strong>: Noah’s miraculous birth, marked by his radiant appearance and immediate speech, signifies his divine selection to survive the Flood and preserve humanity (1 Enoch 106:18).</p>

        <section id="melchizedek">
            <h2>Birth of Melchizedek</h2>

            <p><strong>Significance</strong>: Melchizedek’s miraculous birth to a barren couple and his removal to Eden highlight his eternal priesthood (Hebrews 7:17, KJV).</p>

            <p><strong>Control Mechanism</strong>: Solomon used a divine ring with the Seal of God to command demons to build the Temple.</p>

            Constantine legalized Christianity (Edict of Milan, 313 CE) and ordered 50 Bible copies but did not alter texts. Pagan influences (e.g., Sunday worship, *Codex Justinianus* 3.12.2) were cultural, not textual.</p>
